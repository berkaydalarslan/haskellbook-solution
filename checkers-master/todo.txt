                            To-do for Checkers

+ The two-level notion of test batches in Checkers is proving
  inconvenient. Change to hierarchical. Example of a hierarchy path:
  Data.Reactive, Reactive type, applicative laws, Homomorphism.

+ Rename "Help" to something more descriptive.

+ Generalize monoidMorphism to take a function generator instead of a
  single function.  Use it to define property that says that 'fmap f' is a
  monoid morphism for all f.
